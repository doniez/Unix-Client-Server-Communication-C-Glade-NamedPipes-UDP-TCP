# Unix-Client-Server-Communication-C-Glade-NamedPipes-UDP-TCP
program written in C under Linux; Named pipes; UDP ; TCP ---- programme écrit en c sous Linux
Communication between client and server can be achieved using named pipes and sockets (TCP and UDP).
A server is waiting for client questions in a FIFO pipe named fifo1. A question corresponds to a request from the client to send a random number of items (n) generated by the server. The value of n is a random number between 1 and NMAX, which is also chosen by the client.

In their question, the client includes their process ID (PID) so that the server can notify the client by sending a SIGUSR1 signal when it has written the response. Since multiple clients may be waiting for responses in the same pipe, it is necessary to define a protocol that ensures each client reads the responses intended for them.

The client also informs the server, using the same signal (SIGUSR1), when it has finished reading the responses.

Note: The use of signals, pipes, and process IDs suggests interprocess communication in a Unix-like environment.
